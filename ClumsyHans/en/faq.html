                            This data is needed so that it can be forwarded to the hotel you have booked. A booking that

                            you enter your mobile telephone number in case queries arise at short notice.

                            The cancellation conditions are determined by each hotel and can also vary between bookings
                            made at the same hotel, e.g. during trade fairs (Best Price +). Therefore we cannot issue general
                            conditions. You should decide before booking whether the cancellation conditions suit your needs.
                            This decision is of particular relevance to cancellation rates that cannot be made free of charge.
                            The relevant cancellation conditions can be found in the booking dialogue. In addition, you can
                            find the conditions in the reservation confirmation received after making the booking.
